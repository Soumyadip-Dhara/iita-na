\description{
A simulated binary response dataset representing student performance on
a knowledge assessment with 5 items, including missing values (NA).
This dataset demonstrates the package's ability to handle incomplete data.

  Approximately 15% of the data points are missing. The package handles
  missing data using pairwise deletion when computing diff values.
