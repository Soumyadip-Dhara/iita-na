\title{Compute Diff Value with Missing Data Support}
\usage{
compute_diff_na(dataset, quasiorder)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataset}{A binary data matrix with possible NA values}

\item{quasiorder}{A binary matrix representing a quasi-order (prerequisite structure)}
}
\value{
A list containing:
  \item{diff}{The diff value (proportion of violations)}
  \item{error_rate}{The error rate}
}
\description{
Computes the diff value (discrepancy) between observed data and a quasi-order,
handling missing values appropriately.
}
\details{
For each prerequisite relation i->j in the quasi-order, the function
  counts violations (cases where item j is passed but item i is failed).
  Missing data is handled using pairwise deletion: if either item i or j
  has missing data for a subject, that observation is excluded from the
  calculation for that specific relation.
