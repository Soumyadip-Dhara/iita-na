\title{Inductive Item Tree Analysis with Missing Data Support}
\usage{
iita(dataset, v = NULL, selrule = "minimal")
}
\arguments{
\item{dataset}{A binary data matrix or data frame where rows represent subjects
and columns represent items. Entries should be 0, 1, or NA (missing).}

\item{v}{A vector of competing quasi-orders to test. If NULL (default), all
possible quasi-orders are generated.}

\item{selrule}{Selection rule for choosing quasi-orders. Options are:
"minimal" (default) selects quasi-orders with minimal diff values,
"corrected" applies a corrected selection procedure.}
}
\value{
A list with the following components:
  \item{diff}{Vector of diff values for each quasi-order}
  \item{selection.set.index}{Indices of selected quasi-orders}
  \item{implications}{List of implications (prerequisite relations) for selected quasi-orders}
  \item{v}{The set of competing quasi-orders tested}
  \item{ni}{Number of items}
  \item{nq}{Number of quasi-orders}
  \item{error.rate}{Error rates for each quasi-order}
}
\description{
This function performs inductive item tree analysis (IITA) on binary data
matrices, with support for missing values. For complete data, it produces
identical results to the original DAKS package implementation.
}
\details{
The function handles missing data using pairwise deletion: for each
  subject-item pair, if either item in a prerequisite relation has missing data,
  that pair is excluded from the diff calculation for that relation.

\examples{
# Example with complete data
data <- matrix(c(1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1), ncol=3, byrow=TRUE)
result <- iita(data)

# Example with missing data
data_na <- matrix(c(1,1,0,0,NA,1,1,0,NA,0,1,1), ncol=3, byrow=TRUE)
result_na <- iita(data_na)
