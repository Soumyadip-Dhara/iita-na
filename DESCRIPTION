Description: An adaptation of the IITA (Inductive Item Tree Analysis) function 
    from the DAKS package that supports datasets with missing values. For complete
    data, the function produces identical results to the original DAKS implementation.
    IITA is a data analysis method for deriving quasi-orders from binary data matrices
    in knowledge space theory.
